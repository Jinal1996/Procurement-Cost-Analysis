# **Procurement Cost Analysis and Optimization**  

## **Overview**  
This project focuses on **cost modeling analysis** for global procurement strategies, emphasizing **plastic components and air conditioner**. The analysis explores **cost drivers, supplier selection, and economic trade-offs** in global sourcing using **bottom-up modeling and regression analysis** to optimize costs and enhance procurement decision-making.  

## **Project Objectives**  
This project analyzes **global procurement strategies**, with a focus on **cost modeling for air conditioner and injection-molded parts**. The key objectives include:  

### **1. Understanding Cost Differences Across Regions**  
- Compare **air conditioner and injection-molded part** prices across different global regions.  
- Identify **regional pricing variations** and assess potential **cost disparities** across suppliers.  

### **2. Developing Cost Models for Key Components**  
- **Air Conditioners:** Utilize **parametric modeling** to identify **primary cost drivers**.  
- **Injection-Molded Parts:** Apply **bottom-up cost analysis**, breaking down **material, labor, production, and tooling costs**.  

### **3. Identifying Key Cost Drivers**  
- Implement a **structured cost driver framework**, considering **Design, Facility, Geography, and Operations**.  
- Analyze factors such as **capacity (BTUs per hour), energy efficiency (EER), weight, unit volume, and regional differences** affecting costs.  

### **4. Applying Regression Analysis for Cost Relationships**  
- Evaluate **Air conditioner cost variations** using **regression modeling**.  
- Ensure cost predictions are based on **causal cost drivers** rather than statistical correlations alone.  

### **5. Comparing Supplier Cost Structures for Injection-Molded Parts**  
- Analyze supplier pricing for **epoxy resin, labor, production, and tooling costs**.  
- Estimate **"should-cost" benchmarks** to assess **optimal supplier pricing** and identify **cost-saving opportunities**.  

These objectives drive **data-backed procurement decisions**, optimize **supplier selection**, and improve **cost efficiency** in **global sourcing and manufacturing operations**.

## Cost Driver Framework

This study utilizes a Cost Driver Framework to evaluate key factors that influence costs in manufacturing and supply chain operations. This structured approach helps in identifying cost optimization opportunities, enhancing supplier efficiency, and improving procurement strategies to achieve overall cost reduction.

| **Cost Driver Category** | **Influence on Cost Structure** | **Key Factors to Consider** |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Design** | The complexity and specifications of a product influence material usage and manufacturing cost. | Material selection, design intricacy, customization, product standardization |
| **Facility** | The scale and technological capabilities of production facilities impact efficiency and overhead expenses. | Plant size, automation level, process integration, production flexibility |
| **Geography** | The regional location of manufacturing sites affects labor costs, logistics, and tariff implications. | Wage disparities, import/export taxes, supply chain logistics, currency fluctuations |
| **Operations** | Production efficiency, workforce management, and resource utilization determine overall cost-effectiveness. | Workforce productivity, machine uptime, rejection rates, operational streamlining |

By evaluating these cost drivers, businesses can enhance supplier selection, optimize sourcing strategies, and implement effective cost-reduction initiatives to improve overall procurement efficiency.
